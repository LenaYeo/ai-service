[...] OpenAI has been circulating the documents with potential investors for an investment round that could bring in $7 billion and value the company at $150 billion, among the highest ever for a private tech company. The round, which could close as early as next week, comes at a crucial time for OpenAI, which is experiencing rapid growth but has lost a number of important executives and researchers in the past few months. [...] But it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses like employee salaries and office rent, according to an analysis by a financial professional who has also reviewed the documents. Those numbers do not include paying out equity-based compensation to employees, among several large expenses not fully explained in the documents.",

[...] That year, the for-profit raised an initial round of over $100M, followed by $1 billion from Microsoft.\nBy 2020, to raise additional capital, we needed to demonstrate that our technology could generate revenue before reaching AGI. So we built our first product. In the process, we learned how different real-world safety is from what we expected in the lab. Meanwhile, we also began delivering the “benefits” part of our mission, rather than having to wait until after achieving AGI.",
